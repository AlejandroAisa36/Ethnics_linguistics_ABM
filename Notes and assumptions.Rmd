## Ethnicty 

- For the moment 70% of main ethnicity and 30% of ethnic minority

- Potential 50%-50%. 

- Random distribution within social network: potentiality to create segregation. 

- Ethnicity is synonims with language. Only thing that differentiates is language. 

## Model 

- At each iteration, two random agents interact. Successful communication would determine the level of grievance. 

- Then, sourroudings would determine whether someone would mobilize 

- The degree of each node influences the possibility of mobilizing.
